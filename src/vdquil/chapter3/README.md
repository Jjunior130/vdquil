#### Chapter 3: Data on a Map

We address basic methods of obtaining, massaging, and displaying
spatial data. The exercises are, in order:

 1. **Data**, which delineates the arbitrary data used by all subsequent exercises in this chapter
 2. **Figure 2**, which displays the data using size
 2. Figure 5 uses color instead of size, and plays with different
    color spaces. Figures 3 and 4 can be displayed by commenting out
    small sections as marked.
 3. **Figure 6** uses opposing colors to denote positive/negative
    value, combined with ellipse size showing magnitude
 4. **Figure 7** uses transparency to denote magnitude and color for
    whether the value is positive or negative.
 5. **Mouse** introduces labeling on mouse rollover

Here is figure 7, mapping sample data onto the U.S. states:
