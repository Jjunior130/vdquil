#### Chapter 7: Trees, Hierarchies, and Recursion

We use treemaps and recursion to visualize hierarchical data.

This screenshot of figure 2 shows the word usage in Mark Twain's
*Following the Equator* as a treemap, using Java interop. My version
improves upon the book's by adding a stop list so that the
visualization ignores common English words. I also note in comments
how to play with other subsets of the data.
