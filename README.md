Visualizing Data (in Quil!)

[Ben Fry](http://benfry.com/)'s [Visualizing Data](http://www.amazon.com/Visualizing-Data-Explaining-Processing-Environment/dp/0596514557) has been a lot of fun to work through. However, I found that much of experimenting with the exercises was merely copying and analyzing Processing code. Since I've been working in Clojure recently, I decided to give myself a little more challenge by doing the Processing exercises in Clojure using the most excellent [Quil](https://github.com/quil/quil).

Similar work has been done with Matt Pearson's [Generative Art](https://github.com/quil/quil/blob/master/examples/gen_art/README.md).

If you find an error (or even something non-idiomatic to Clojure) please contact me on github or via email (first name, period, last name, gmail).
