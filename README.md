Visualizing Data (in Quil!)

Ben Fry's Visualizing Data has been a lot of fun to work through. However, I found that much of experimenting with the exercises was merely copying and analyzing Processing code. Since I've been working in Clojure recently, I decided to give myself a little more challenge by doing the Processing exercises in Clojure using the most excellent Quil.

Similar work has been done with Matt Pearson's [Generative Art](https://github.com/quil/quil/blob/master/examples/gen_art/README.md).
